## Changes for 2.9

*   **Added French and Turkish translations.**
*   **Formatted View:** Added a "View Formatted" button in chat dialogs to view the conversation with proper styling (Headings, Bold, Code) in a standard browseable window.
*   **Markdown Setting:** Added a new option "Clean Markdown in Chat" in Settings. Unchecking this allows users to see raw Markdown syntax (e.g., `**`, `#`) in the chat window.
*   **Dialog Management:** Fixed an issue where the "Refine Text" or chat windows would open multiple times or fail to focus correctly.
*   **UX Improvements:** Standardized file dialog titles to "Open" and removed redundant speech announcements (e.g., "Opening menu...") for a smoother experience.

## Changes for 2.8
* Added Italian translation.
* **Status Reporting:** Added a new command (NVDA+Control+Shift+I) to announce the current status of the add-on (e.g., "Uploading...", "Analyzing...").
* **HTML Export:** The "Save Content" button in result dialogs now saves output as a formatted HTML file, preserving styles like headings and bold text.
* **Settings UI:** Improved the Settings panel layout with accessible grouping.
* **New Models:** Added support for gemini-flash-latest and gemini-flash-lite-latest.
* **Languages:** Added Nepali to supported languages.
* **Refine Menu Logic:** Fixed a critical bug where "Refine Text" commands would fail if the NVDA interface language was not English.
* **Dictation:** Improved silence detection to prevent incorrect text output when no speech is input.
* **Update Settings:** "Check for updates on startup" is now disabled by default to comply with Add-on Store policies.
* Code Cleanup.

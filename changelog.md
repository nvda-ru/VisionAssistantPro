\## Changes for 2.9

\*   \*\*Added French translation.\*\*

\*   \*\*Markdown Setting:\*\* Added a new option "Clean Markdown in Chat" in Settings. Unchecking this allows users to see raw Markdown syntax (e.g., `\*\*`, `#`) in the chat window.

\*   \*\*Dialog Management:\*\* Fixed an issue where the "Refine Text" or chat windows would open multiple times or fail to focus correctly.

\*   \*\*UX Improvements:\*\* Standardized file dialog titles to "Open" and removed redundant speech announcements (e.g., "Opening menu...") for a smoother experience.
